Code for reproducing the plots found in my paper The Perceptions of Leadership in Anáhuac University.

Summary: ''We are Anahuac Mexico. Positive Action Leaders'' reads the message first encountered when accessing the webpage of Anáhuac University—one of Mexico’s most renowned higher learning institutions. And it is true: leadership is a key component of Anáhuac’s curriculum. But what exactly does it mean to be a leader? Although answering such a broad question may be impossible, Anáhuac students could certainly have insights as to what are the key characteristics of leadership. In this paper, I use statistical tools to analyze a survey on leadership answered by Anáhuac University’s undergraduate students. The survey listed a series of qualities—intelligence, charisma, and eloquence, among others—and asked respondents to rank, on a 0 to 10 scale, how important they considered each one. Variables such as age, gender, semester, and program were also recorded so as to determine if leadership is perceived differently among certain groups.
